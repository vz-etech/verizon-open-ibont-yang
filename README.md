## Verizon IBONT YANG
Verizon’s IBONT is an ONT type providing the Ethernet Network Interface Device (NID) functionality in Verizon’s E-Line architecture which delivers Ethernet access and switched Ethernet services. The IBONT is a dual-managed device which supports OMCI provisioning of the basic traffic management functionality and the NETCONF/YANG management path for the NID management and control.

This repository contains an exhaustive collection of common YANG modules, comprising a specification of Verizon Open NETCONF/YANG that is used to manage the NID functionality of the IBONT device and that effectively specifies the IBONT NID management interface, thus providing, along with the Verizon OpenOMCI specification, the basis for IBONT interoperability.

The use of proprietary YANG modules by IBONT implementations is not allowed. However, extensibility of Verizon Open NETCONF/YANG implies that a party, which is willing to contribute a vendor-specific YANG module towards the common specification, may present the case to the Verizon Open NETCONF/YANG working group (vz-open-netconf-yang@verizon.com) for consideration. Once properly reviewed, modified (if necessary), approved, and published in the present repository under a uniform Apache license (Version 2.0 of January 2004), a new module becomes an integral part of the Verizon Open NETCONF/YANG specification.
